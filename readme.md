# Amazon Kindle Review Sentiment Analysis

## Project Description
This project performs sentiment analysis on Amazon Kindle reviews using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify customer reviews into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. This classification helps in gaining insights into customer opinions and improving product offerings.

## Installation and Setup Instructions
To run this project on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amazon-kindle-review-sentiment-analysis.git
    cd amazon-kindle-review-sentiment-analysis
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Download the dataset:**

    Place your dataset (`all_kindle_review.csv`) in the `data/` directory (if applicable).

5. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "Amazon Kindle Review Sentiment Analysis.ipynb"
    ```

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute each cell sequentially. The notebook is organized as follows:

1. **Data Loading:** Load the dataset containing Kindle reviews.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the data to gain initial insights.
4. **Sentiment Analysis:** Apply NLP techniques to classify the sentiment of each review.
5. **Results and Visualization:** Visualize the sentiment distribution and model performance.
